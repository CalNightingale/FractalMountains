    <h1>Fractal Mountains</h1>
    <p>Based on <a href="https://benhaller.com/pubs/Meir1991.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a> by Eli Meir and Ben Haller</p>
    <h2>Part 1: Making the triangles</h2>
    <p>We represent the mountain as a collection of vertices.</p>
    <p>The most efficient way to store them is simply as a 2D array of height values.</p>
    <p>The x and y coordinates can be derived from the index in the array, and the z coordinate is the height value.</p>
    <p>If the mountain were to be viewed from above, it would appear as 2D triangles. The z coordinate would be irrelevant.</p>
    <p>The triangles are then simply the 3 vertices that make up each triangle.</p>
    <p>The smallest supported number of points is 4. We use this to create a rombus.</p>
